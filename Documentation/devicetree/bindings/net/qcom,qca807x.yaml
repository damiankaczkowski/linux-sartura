  qcom,fiber-enable:
    description: |
      If present, then PHYs combo port is configured to operate in combo
      mode. In combo mode autodetection of copper and fiber media is
      used in order to support both of them.
      Combo mode can be strapped as well, if not strapped this property
      will set combo support anyway.
    type: boolean

  qcom,psgmii-az:
    description: |
      If present, then PSMGII PHY will advertise 802.3-az support to
      the MAC.

  qcom,single-led-1000:
    description: |
      If present, then dedicated 1000 Mbit will light up for 1000Base-T.
      This is a workround for boards with a single LED instead of two.
    type: boolean
